defmodule Claptrap.Consumer.Adapter do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines the adapter contract for the Consumer subsystem.

  A consumer adapter translates a source-specific protocol into the normalized
  entry attributes consumed by `Claptrap.Catalog.create_entry/1`.

  The worker model in `Claptrap.Consumer.Worker` expects adapters to expose
  both their ingestion mode and the functions needed for that mode:

    * `mode/0` declares whether the adapter is `:pull` or `:push`.
    * `fetch/1` is used by pull-based workers.
    * `ingest/2` is reserved for push-based ingestion entrypoints.
    * `validate_config/1` checks source configuration before work starts.

  ## Return shape and failure semantics

  Adapter callbacks return either:

    * `{:ok, [map()]}` with normalized entry attribute maps, or
    * `{:error, reason}` for failures the caller may retry.

  In the current implementation, `Claptrap.Consumer.Worker` retries on
  `{:error, reason}` from `fetch/1`. Exceptions raised by adapters are not
  rescued by the worker and therefore crash that worker process, allowing OTP
  supervision to restart it.
